Light-weight, modular PHP / MySQL framework.

How to Use
=========
This is a bare-bones framework that uses PDO for the database and raw PHP for templating. Everything is completely modular. Most modules can be used without any dependencies at all, including the framework. <br />
Almost all of the class methods are declared static, so you can echo them right into your template. <br />
e.g. <?php echo UserRegistration::form($pdo); ?>

Namespace
===
This framework provides more of a common namespace than anything. The database tables and columns are used in the "db" folder. They can be easily installed in the install page.
