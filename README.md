Light-weight, modular PHP / MySQL framework.

How to Use
=========
This is a bare-bones framework that uses PDO for the database and raw PHP for templating. Everything is completely modular. Most modules can be used without any dependencies at all, including the framework. Almost all of the class methods are declared static, so you can echo them right into your template. i.e. <?php echo UserRegistration::form($pdo); ?>
